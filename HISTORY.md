## 1.3.0 (2014-07-25)

## 1.2.0 (2014-05-19)

* Fixed scenario where job does not get retried correctly when `perform` is not called as expected.
* Feature: Optional `@expire_retry_key_after` settings; expires retry counters from redis to save you cleaning up stale state.

**INCLUDES NON-BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGES**

* IMPORTANT: `retry_limit` behaviour has changed. (Nicolas Fouch√©)
    PREVIOUSLY: 0 == infinite retries.
           NOW: -1 == infinite retries; 0 == means never retry.

* Bugfix: `#redis_retry_key` incorrectly built key when custom identifier was used. (Bogdan Gusiev)
* Feature: Ability to sleep worker after re-queuing a job, may be used to bias
           against the same worker from picking up the job again. (Michael Keirnan)

* Added example demo application.
* Added Bundler `Gemfile`.
